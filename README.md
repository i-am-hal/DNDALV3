# DNDALV3
This is a silly project I made ages ago, this is the third iteration of the program written in Nim, rather than Python. 
There's some extra bits that really are dangling threads (as I basically abandoned the project), but feel free to look around.
To make this, simply use nim to build the repl, and run it away.
